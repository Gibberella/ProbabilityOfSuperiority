# ProbabilityOfSuperiority
---
Code snippet for probability of superiority calculation from Monte Carlo samples of a Metabolic Flux Analysis model. 
## Instructions
---
1. Unzip contents of the two compressed files to separate folders. These are the flux estimates in .csv format for each Monte Carlo sample for two different model setups.
2. Change the path variables in the first cell of the *ProbabilityOfSuperiority.ipynb* Jupyter notebook to point at these two folders.
3. Run the cells of the notebook sequentially.
4. The output file *ProbabilityOfSuperiority.csv* contains the probability of superiority of Model B to Model A on a flux-by-flux basis.
